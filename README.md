# Human-Activity-Recognition

Human activities Recognition system is a solution of our surrounding problems. Human Activity Recognition from video has gained lot of attention because of its increasing demand in many real life applications, for e.g. video surveillance, entertainment, health care, child and old age home, robotics, etc. In this project report, there are several steps involved in human activity recognition system, such as Pre-processing, segmentation, tracking of motion, pose estimation, feature extraction and recognition of activities. Here we use Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to classify the Activities and segmentation technique such as background subtraction. Finally we use kth dataset, it is commonly available dataset which gives more accurate output while implementing human activity Recognition from a video. For the evaluation purpose we take new video database containing 2391 sequences which contains six activity perform by 25 people in four different scenarios. The result of human activity recognition shows the method and demonstrate its advantage compared to other relative approaches for human activity recognition
